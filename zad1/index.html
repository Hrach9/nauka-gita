    <h1>I’m a liar</h1>
    <h3>NEMRA</h3>

    <p>I was blind, you were kind You were beautiful When I lost you My songs became lyrical</p>

    <p>I’m not high, I’m not drunk You’re my miracle You’ve been charming, easy, nice I’ve been hysterical</p>

    <p>When I left I realized That you were wonderful You were the one who’s made my life more colourful</p>

    <p>I was wrong I admit I’m just a mindless fool And things are getting cruel</p>

    <p>When, every time I see you, I’m on fire I said I do not love you, I’m a liar Every time I see you, I’m on fire I said that I do not love you</p>

    <p>Holding a magnifying Glass in my hand I’m trying to find some love Inside your eyes again You don’t trust You don’t care You don’t believe my pain Now I’m gradually going insane</p>

    <p>And I laughed, hahaha I thought your tears were fake I was sure it’s just another way To make my heart shake</p>

    <p>I was wrong I repeat I was a mindless fool Things are getting cruel</p>

    <p>When, every time I see you, I’m on fire I said I do not love you, I’m a liar Every time I see you, I’m on fire I said that I do not love you</p>

    <p>When, every time I see you, I’m on fire I said I do not love you, I’m a liar Every time I see you, I’m on fire I said that I do not love you</p>

    <p>Every time I see you, I’m on fire I said I do not love you, I’m a liar Every time I see you, I’m on fire I said that I do not love you</p>

    <p>Every time I see you, I’m on fire I said I do not love you, I’m a liar Every time I see you, I’m on fire I said that I do not love you</p>

    <p>I was blind, you were kind You were beautiful When I lost you My songs became lyrical</p>

    <p>I’m not high, I’m not drunk You’re my miracle You’ve been charming, easy, nice I’ve been hysterical</p>

    <p>When I left I realized That you were wonderful You were the one who’s made my life more colourful</p>

    <p>I was wrong I admit I’m just a mindless fool And things are getting cruel</p>
